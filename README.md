Unused Modules
==============

Displays a report of unused modules on your site. This provides an easy way for
admins to know when a given module isn't in-use and can be uninstalled.

Unused modules are determined on a case-by-case basis. For example, the core
Taxonomy module is considered unused if there are no vocabularies defined. An
API hook allows contrib modules to define when they're considered unused.
